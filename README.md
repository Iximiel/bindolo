# Bindolo - notebook

I am trying to play with the a AI a bit here

The scope of this little project is to avoid writing the definition of the words in bindolo on paper.
But running this on something like a local server (aka my wifi connected laptop) and accessing to it via a local address
Hoping that publishing this to github and using AI does not creates a backdoor to my wifi here it is!

The actual use is to avoid subjecting my friends to my horrible horrible writing.

Yesterday copilot tried to gaslight me that I can't use the following options:
```toml
[tool.ruff]
indent-width = 2
[tool.ruff.format]
indent-style = "space"
```
